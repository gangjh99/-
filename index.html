      <h2>Hope</h2>
      <p>
        Hope is an optimistic state of mind that is based on an expectation of positive outcomes with respect to events and circumstances in one's life or the world at large.[1] As a verb, its definitions include: "expect with confidence" and "to
        cherish a desire with anticipation."[2]

        in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages
        have a very different syntax, semantic, and use.
        As a specialist in positive psychology, Snyder studied how hope and forgiveness can impact several aspects of life such as health, work, education, and personal meaning. He postulated that there are three main things that make up hopeful
        thinking:[15]

        Goals – Approaching life in a goal-oriented way.
        Pathways – Finding different ways to achieve your goals.
        Agency – Believing that you can instigate change and achieve these goals.

        A rose expressing hope, at Auschwitz concentration camp
        In other words, hope was defined as the perceived capability to derive pathways to desired goals and motivate oneself via agency thinking to use those pathways.

        Snyder argues that individuals who are able to realize these three components and develop a belief in their ability are hopeful people who can establish clear goals, imagine multiple workable pathways toward those goals, and persevere, even
        when obstacles get in their way.

        Snyder proposed a "Hope Scale" which considered that a person's determination to achieve their goal is their measured hope. Snyder differentiates between adult-measured hope and child-measured hope. The Adult Hope Scale by Snyder contains 12
        questions; 4 measuring 'pathways thinking', 4 measuring 'agency thinking', and 4 that are simply fillers. Each subject responds to each question using an 8-point scale.[16] Fibel and Hale measure hope by combining Snyder's Hope Scale with
        their own Generalized Expectancy for Success Scale (GESS) to empirically measure hope.[17] Snyder regarded that psychotherapy can help focus attention on one's goals, drawing on tacit knowledge of how to reach them.[18] Similarly, there is an
        outlook and a grasp of reality to hope, distinguishing No Hope, Lost Hope, False Hope and Real Hope, which differ in terms of viewpoint and realism.[19]
